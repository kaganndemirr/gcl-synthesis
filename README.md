# TSN
To be updated!


This program synthesizes gate control lists (GSLs) for time-sensingitve networks (TSN).
The code is implemented in Java and uses Google OR-Tools as the solver.

Installation:
For installing the code, you may need to install the followings:
1. Eclipse
2. Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
3. Google OR Tools.

Note: There are some incompatibility issuses between different versions of JRE and Google OR-Tools.

Please cite the following paper when using the code:

The program imlements several methods for GCL synthesis:
A: Romon method --> IEEE 802.1 Qbv gate control list synthesis using array theory encoding
B: Silviu method --> Scheduling real-time communication in IEEE 802.1 Qbv time sensitive networks
C: Niklas method --> Window-based schedule synthesis for industrial IEEE 802.1 Qbv TSN networks
D: Reza method --> Communication scheduling for control performance in TSN-based fog computing platforms
